# React Task Manager

A simple and efficient task manager application built with React. This project allows users to create, edit, and track their tasks, with all data saved directly in the browser using Local Storage.

## Features

-   **Create Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your list.
-   **Edit Tasks:** Modify existing tasks to update their content.
-   **Status Tracking:** Mark tasks with different progress statuses (e.g., "Pending", "In Progress", "Completed").
-   **Progress-Based Filtering:** Filter the task list to view tasks based on their current status.
-   **Data Persistence:** Tasks are saved in the browser's Local Storage, so your data persists even after closing the tab.
